When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?
     

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
  * git should not automatically pull the remote change and merge into my local since my local change may get overridden
  * As a user I wont be able to understand what changes were merged and what lines were changed
  * It might be very confusing and difficult to understand the history of commits

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    * fork is a form of clone which happens in github (remote git server) 
    * clone helps to replicate a remote repository in the local machine 
    * branch is a from of clone which occurs within a local working dir (local repo)

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?
  
    * Would be helpful to analyze the remote branch before merging when there is no internet connection
    
   

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

   * you could create a zip file of the changes and then use that for collabration
   * you could copy all the files into a common place so that others can download it
   * however it will be very hard to manually track and change those files
   * it would be time consuming for eg 1 person would send the zip file of his/her changes to the other. Then the reveiwer will comment on the changes and send back the zip file. This will happen back and forth which is time conusming and will also cost ineffective

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?
